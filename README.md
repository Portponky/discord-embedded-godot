# DiscordEmbeddedGodot

A Godot plugin/library to interact with the Discord Embedded App SDK from Web builds, with zero effort!

> [!NOTE]
> Note about Godot support in Discord: Godot 4 builds will not work in Discord (as of 18 March 2024). If you really want to use Godot 4, get version 4.3-beta5 or newer, and disable "Thread Support" in export options.
